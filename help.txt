npm run start


docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build


docker-compose up --build
    What it does:
        Builds your images from scratch according to the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml configurations (if there are changes).

        Then, starts (or recreates) the containers with the newly built images.

        If the containers don’t exist, it creates and starts them.

    When to use:
        When you made changes to your Dockerfile or application code and want to rebuild the images.

        When you want to ensure containers run the latest build.



docker-compose restart
    What it does:

        Stops the running containers and then starts them again without rebuilding images.

        It just restarts the existing containers using the current images.

    When to use:
        When you want to restart the containers quickly, e.g., after configuration changes that don’t require rebuilding images.

        When you want to refresh the running app without rebuilding.

If you want to rebuild and restart everything fresh, use up --build.
If you just want to restart without rebuilding, use restart.
